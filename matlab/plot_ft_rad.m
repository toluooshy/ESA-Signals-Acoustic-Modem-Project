function [X, f] = plot_ft_rad(x, fs)
    % plots the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the signal x
    % which is assumed to originate from a Continous-time signal 
    % sampled with frequency fs
    % the function returns X and f. 
    % In other words, this function plots the FT of the DT signal x 
    % with the frequency axis labeled as if it were the original CT signal
    %
    % X contains the frequency response 
    % f contains the frequency samples
